To run Part one (bpnn)
Extract "Part1bpnn.zip"
Through terminal: cd Part1bpnn
			% ./nntrain iris.net iris.pat
				% ./nntest iris.net iris.pat weights.dat

To run Part two 
Use the runnable jar named "A2_Part2.jar"
		through the terminal type the command:
			% java -jar A2_Part2.jar regression.txt

(Regression.txt is the argument the jar requires to run)
I have used the JGAP library downloaded through IntelliJ Maven Repo
I have tested this on the ecs machines and it would only run after I added this library to the IntelliJ project. So the tutor may have to open my A2_Part2 project in IntelliJ and install the library before running the jar.
